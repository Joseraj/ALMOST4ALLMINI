Welcome to the ALMOST4ALLMINI wiki!

# ALMOST4ALLMINI
Arduino Mini board for [Mysensors](http://www.mysensors.org/)

This board is intended to be valid for almost any sensor/node available on mysensors site.

I hate to fight sharing 1 pin for the grounds.
The main goal is to have on the board independent connectors for every sensor that i want to use in one node.

The board can be powered with battery (from 0,9 to 6,5V), 3.3V or 5V regulated.
The Arduino pro mini is powered with 3.3V or battery, so that is the reference for analog I/O. (No 5V)

There is the possibility of using some SMD resistors, capacitors and ICs. All of this are optional, but adding this hardware on board allows to use more simple and economic sensors and some extras (low cost temperature sensor, battery monitor, external eprom, signing)
